   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* InterZone Surface Azimuths -- mismatch
   ************* ..The azimuths (outward facing angle) of two interzone surfaces should not be the same.
   ************* ..Normally, the absolute difference between the two azimuths will be 180 degrees.
   ************* ..You can turn on the report: Output:Surfaces:List,Details; to inspect your surfaces.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
